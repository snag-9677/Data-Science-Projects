As the world wages war to free itself from the clutches of the novel coronavirus, it is the duty of every citizen
to mobilize all the weapons at the their disposal such as social distancing and wearing masks. Data is also
a very great and a crucial weapon that we currently have to stop further spread of the disease.

It is a common preconception in Toronto that the existence of hospitals cause a surge in the number of
COVID-19 cases in it's vicinity because hospitals are the places where most of the people who have the
COVID-19 are conrmed. This assumption has led to major public unrest and a cause for panic.

In this project, I use the data for number of confirmed cases in the suburbs of Downtown Toronto and look
at it's relationship with the number of hospitals in the area. This analysis will help us understand if places
where the most confirmed cases go i.e - hospitals form hubs for the spread of COVID-19 or not.
The analysis is then extended to see the relationship between the number of confirmed cases and the distance
from hospitals which have been assigned as testing centers so as to verify the preconception that living near
hospitals increases the chances of one catching the virus.
